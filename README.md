//////Generally, we don't need to worry too much about security with the public APIs that we'll be using, but it's important to be aware of the security issues around API keys. Make sure you store all keys in a local .env file that's never pushed to Github. dotenv-webpack should also be a regular tool in your toolbox whenever you're using sensitive variables in webpack projects. And once again, when you do push projects to GitHub that require API keys, make sure to include instructions in the README so that other users can clone your project and use their own API keys to see what you've built. That means including all steps for getting a key - from the link to sign up for an account to any steps to getting an API key to using a personal key with a .env file. Adding both a .env file with properly stored API variables as well as instructions for adding an API key is a requirement for this section's independent project.
